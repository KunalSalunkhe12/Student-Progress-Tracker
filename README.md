# Student Progress Tracker:
This is our first project where we are working with a real time data set of past 3 years student provided by the college to work on our innovative idea.

* The idea behind the project is to analyze the insights of the student data based on their academic career and categories them accordingly.

* Also this was our end semester mini project, where we have used SVM(support vector machine) for model prediction and many more tools and technologies for building amazing frontend:
      1. React
      2. Js
      3. Flask(Api)
      4. Node.js
      5. python(Machine Learning)
      6. SVM
      7. Tailwind

**We have also implemented some feature engineering and statistical engineering techniques to make our model more reliable and accurate**
